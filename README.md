Raperberry Pi Bot

this bot is build for home play only, i have a Tamiya track chasis for driving.

4AA battery to drive the motor, and 8AA battery to power on Rasperberry Pi.

I will put hardware diagram later maybe.

Current plan for software side:

1. Driver layer:
   motor driver
   Camera driver
   
2. Processing
   Path planning(position estimation and oath estimation)
   Environment perception(camera environment understanding)

3. Intelligence
   SLAM.
   maybe ROS on raperberry Pi.
   will see how far we can go...
